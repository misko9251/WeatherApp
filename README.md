Currently, this application is best viewed on mobile. I took a mobile first approach to building this app and had a lot of fun with the design.

In the future, I hope to go back to this project and add more media queries/styling to enhance the experience on larger devices such as laptop/desktop.

This was a lot of fun to work on and I got the chance to play around with API keys and a ton of useful data.
